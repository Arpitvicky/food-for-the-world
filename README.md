## food for the world

with the coronavirus going around a lot of shops, restaurants, companies are closing. people are getting out of work. uber drivers, flight attendants, waiters and a lot of other people are out of work because of this virus. we wanted to help those who have been/will be put out of work. if people keep getting fed & the basic needs are met people will better follow the quarantine and will have more strength to fight the virus. :muscle:
