## food for the world

With the coronavirus going around a lot of shops, restaurants, companies are closing. People are getting out of work and are unable to afford food. We wanted to help those who have been/will be put out of work. If people keep getting fed & the basic needs are met, then people will better follow the quarantine and will have more strength to fight the virus. :muscle:
